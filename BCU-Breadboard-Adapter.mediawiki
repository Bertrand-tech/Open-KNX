== Description ==

{|
|-
| An Adapter to connect with an standard Breadboard which hosts BCU and KNX connector.<br>
You can use it with [[NanoBCU]], MicroBCU2 or MicroBCU. Also SiemensBCU is possible.<br>
You can isolate the BCU by use of the Adum1201 or just bridge it together. The Adum can also be used to shift levels (3V3 vs. 5V).<br>
Be carefull when the Adum1201 is solderd - Rx and Tx should not be bridged in that case, just bridge Vcc and GND for a non-isolated setup.<br>
There is a possibility to connect the second voltage from the BCU to the lower Rail or to connect a external voltage.

=== Version history ===
* V00.01 - first prototype series
* V00.02
** added a second 7x1 pin header for Micro/[[NanoBCU]], to enable male and female BCUs to be connected
** moved adum to top layer and added pin headers for usage of a adum1201 breakout board\
** added additional pins for VCC/GND buses to improve mechanical stability

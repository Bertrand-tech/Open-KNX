== OpenKNX Modules ==

OpenKNX provides reusable software modules, which can be adopted to community hardware.
The following prefixes will classify the repositories:

* OAM - OpenKNX Application Module - Contains usually a complete application (software and ETS-Application), which can be combined with other OAM, but can also be used standalone
* OFM - OpenKNX Function Module - Contains usually a reusable part for an application (software and ETS-parts) like an IO-channel or a humidity sensor. Can be used in an own application or as an implementation idea.
* OGM - OpenKNX Generic Module - any generic or common implementations used in OpenKNX

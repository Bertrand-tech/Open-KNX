== Description ==

{|
|-
| The system REG1 is a framework and a class of devices sharing common components.<br><br>
It is designed for usage on 35mm DIN Rails in switch cabinets and has a width of 1 TE (17.5mm).<br><br>
The modular approach speeds up developement and gives the possibity to use assembled components.<br><br>
A REG1 device consists of a controller PCB with MCU, Flash, KNX-Connector, USB-Connector, Debug-interface, BCU and 2 IOs. It can be expanded by an application PCB which holds additional functions and connectors (FETs, sensor ICs, terminals, relay). The PCBs are mounted in a custom 3D-printed case.

| A HAT for Raspberry Pi, connecting the RaspPi to KNX TP with the use of the UART interface on GPIO-Pins.<br><br>
When used with a RaspPi 4, it is possible to use a second [[NanoBCU]] to connect to two individual KNX TP Lines.<br><br>
The RaspPi is isolated with magnetic couplers (2kV) from KNX TP, the two KNX TP lines are also isolated from each other.<br><br>
The HAT is designed for usage within a DIN RAIL case. Unfortunately the USB port to power the RaspPi is located on the side. On this HAT, there is also a DC/DC converter which powers the RaspPi over the GPIO Pins. You can input 12V up to 30V DC.

== Sourcing ==

You can get PCBs and partially (SMD parts) assembled kits [http://shop.sirsydom.de here] for a donation.<br>
For the parts I made a [https://www.reichelt.de/my/1814014 BOM at Reichelt] for your convenience.<br>
Parts not availibe at reichelt: 47uH power inductor, min. 3A (e.g. FXL1360-470-M) - I recommend choosing the assembled kit if the DC-DC converter will be used.<br>
Reichelt BOM without parts for the DC-DC converter: [https://www.reichelt.de/my/1828602]<br>
I added 2 different Connectors for the RPi-Headers - one stacking header, one normal female header. Remove the one you don't need.<br><br>
The 35mm DIN rail case on the photos is availible at [https://www.rasppishop.de/Hutschienen-Gehaeuse-fuer-Rabperry-Pi- rasppishop]

| * KNX2 BCU only works on RPi4, don't solder the parts if you don't need it
* power supply is also optional (part numbers with "3" like L3 or D32). If you want to feed 5V over J30, leave away U3 and D33 and close JP3)
* on BOT there are 4 solder jumpers to select the UARTs of the RasPi4 to connect the BCUs to. On RasPi 2 and 3 use PIN 8/10 option.
* the StepDown Converter will be very hard to solder with iron due to large copper areas
* for each [[NanoBCU]] it can be selected by the usage of the solder jumpers on the bottom side, to which UART of the Pi they will be connected. RasPi previous 4 only have one UART, use KNX1 with UART in PIN8/10 in that case.

== Description ==

{|
|-
| The system UP1 is a framework and a class of devices sharing common components.<br><br>
It is designed for usage in switch boxes inside the wall or behind switches.<br><br>
The modular approach speeds up developement and gives the possibity to use assembled components.<br><br>
An UP1 device consists of a controller pcb with MCU, Flash, KNX-Connector and BCU, an application pcb which holds the function (FETs, sensor ICs, terminals, relay) and a 3D-printed case.

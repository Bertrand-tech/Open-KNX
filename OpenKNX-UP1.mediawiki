The system UP1 is a framework and a class of devices sharing common components.

The modular approach speeds up developement and gives the possibity to use assembled components.

An UP1 device consists of a controller pcb with MCU, Flash, KNX-Connector and BCU, an application pcb which holds the function (FETs, sensor ICs, terminals, relay and a 3D-printed case

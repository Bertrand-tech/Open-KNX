The system UP1 is a framework and a class of devices sharing common components.

It is designed for usage in switch boxes inside the wall or behind switches.

The modular approach speeds up developement and gives the possibity to use assembled components.

An UP1 device consists of a controller pcb with MCU, Flash, KNX-Connector and BCU, an application pcb which holds the function (FETs, sensor ICs, terminals, relay and a 3D-printed case

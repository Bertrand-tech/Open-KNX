== Sourcing ==

You will get complete kits with almost all parts already be soldered [http://spenden.openknx.de here] for a donation. Some soldering skills are still  neccessary.

== Assembly ==

* solder J100 - soldering pins for the KNX connector
* solder J105 - 02x04 2.00mm THT pin header for connecting the front panel
* solder 01x07 2.54mm angled pin header to the [[NanoBCU]]
* solder J200 - 01x04 3.5mm THT screw terminal for I/O
* solder the NanoBCU to the Controller2040
* configure the ribbon cable by pressing the connectors
* solder J1 - 02x04 2.00mm SMD pin header to the REG1-Front-Universal
* connect Controller and Front with the ribbon cable
* mount it into the REG1-Case
* put the cover on the case and tighten the 6 screws gently
* connect with a Micro-USB cable to your computer and load a firmware of your choice

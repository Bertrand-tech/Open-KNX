== Description ==

{|
|-
| 
The REG1-Controller2040 is part of the [[OpenKNX-REG1]] system and holds KNX-Connector, a [[NanoBCU]], a RP2040 DualCore Cortex M0 MCU, 16MB QSPI Flash, USB-connector, a debug interface and lots of GPIO to connect to the application.<br><br>
On the bottom there are optional footprints for mounting Prog, Reset und Bootloader Switches and a Prog-LED<br><br>
Especially for, but not limited to, using the two GPIO as I2C, there are some footprints for optional pull up resistors.

== USB/SWD interface ==

To connect the REG1-Controller2040 to your computer for debugging or loading firmware, there is a 8pin interface with the USB lines, power and SWD. Be carefull, the 5V from USB have to be lowered to 3.3V externally.

For your convinience, there is the [[UP1-Progger]] with a USB connector and JTAG interface.

Be carefull: never connect to USB and KNX simultaneously without using a USB isolator.

== Sourcing  ==

You will get complete kits with almost all parts already be soldered [http://spenden.openknx.de here] for a donation. Some soldering skills are still  neccessary.

== Final assembly ==

There are some parts that must be soldered by the user:

* J100 - soldering pins for the KNX connector 
* GN100 - 01x07 2.54mm pin header for connecting the [[NanoBCU]]
* J105 - 02x04 2.00mm THT pin header for connecting the front panel


Optional parts
* J101 - 01x08 1.27mm THT angled female pin header for connecting the [[UP1-Progger]] - only needed for developers that need SWD debugging
* J200 - 01x04 3.5mm THT screw terminal for I/O
* R109/R110 - 0805 SMD resistor for I/O

when used in the [[REG1-Module-Case]]:
* SW100 - Prog Switch
* SW101 - Bootloader Switch
* SW102 - Reset Switch
* LED100 - 0805 SMD LED
* R100 - 0805 1k SMD resistor


optional part placement is defined by the application.

== Developer documentation ==

=== Version history ===

* V00.01 - first prototype (5 produced)
* V00.02 - added switches and Prog-LED on the bottom side (not produced)
* V00.03 - rotated Front connector (10 produced)
* V00.10 - added D150 to decouple USB from KNX, added some silkscreen

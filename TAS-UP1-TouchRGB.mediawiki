The OpenKNX TAS-UP1-TouchRGB is a modular switch sensor with up to 16 Touch Keys, 16 RGB LED, 10 binary inputs and a I2C sensor interface.<br><br>
It is part of the [[OpenKNX-UP1]] system and designed for usage in switch boxes inside the wall or behind switches (ger: Unterputzmodul).<br><br>
Currently it supports SHT2x, SHT3x, BME280 and DS18B20 sensors. Support for almost any digital sensor types (one- or two wire) is possible and may be introduced by 3rd party into the open source firmware.

'''The module is in working prototype status and not yet finished.'''

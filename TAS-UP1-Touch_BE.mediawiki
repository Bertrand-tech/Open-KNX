The OpenKNX TAS-UP1-Touch_BE is a modular switch sensor with up to 16 Touch Keys, 16 RGB LED, 8 binary inputs and a I2C sensor interface.<br><br>
It is part of the [[OpenKNX-UP1]] system and designed for usage in switch boxes inside the wall or behind switches (ger: Unterputzmodul).<br><br><br>
It can be used mounted on top of a wall mount (de: Unterputzdose) as base for a touch interface - there is a PCB frame enabling that.<br>
In that case it can be used with one or up to two touch interfaces with up to 8 switches/LEDs each.<br>
The binary inputs and the sensor interface can also be used in that case e.g. for connecting additional switches or reed relays<br><br>
The frame can be cut off and the module can be housed in a 3D-printed case and can be used as a switch interface (de: Tasterschnittstelle) with 8 inputs and a sensor interface.<br><br>

The sensor interface is meant to connect a digital air quality sensor. (SHT2x/3x/BME280 etc..)<br><br>
The 8 binary inputs can be used additionally or without the touch functionality - e.g. for connecting reed contacts for windows or to connect "normal" tactile switches like GIRA 14700<br><br>

'''The module is in working prototype status and not yet finished.'''

=== Case ===


== User Documentation ==

=== Assembly ===

To enable a firmware update in a mounted state when using the wall mount frame, it is recommended to solder J101 on the [[UP1-Controller2040]] on TOP instead of BOT and use a 01x08 1.27mm THT female pin header instead of a male one.

== Adaptions ==

Since the CATIA sources are in the repo, feel free to adapt the generic UP1-Case to fit your needs.

As an alternative, you can print the UP1-Case and make cut outs for e.g. terminals with a knife or drill.

If you don't have CATIA, you may work with the STL and modify it with a CAD of your choice.

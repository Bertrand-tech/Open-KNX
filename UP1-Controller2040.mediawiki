| 
The UP1-Controller2040 is part of the [[OpenKNX UP1]] system and holds KNX-Connector, a [[NanoBCU]], a RP2040 DualCore Cortex M0 MCU, 16MB QSPI Flash, Prog Button, Prog LED, a debug interface and lots of GPIO to connect to the application.<br><br>
There are also two footprints for a I2C temperature sensor and a I2C EEPROM.<br><br>
Especially for, but not limited to, using GPIO as I2C, there are some footprints for optional pull up resistors.

== USB/SWD interface ==

To connect the UP1-Controller2040 to your computer for debugging or loading firmware, there is a 7pin interface with the USB lines, power and SWD. Be carefull, the 5V from USB have to be lowered to 3.3V externally.

For your convinience, there is the [[UP1-Progger]] with a USB connector.

Be carefull: never connect to USB and KNX simultaneously without using a USB isolator.

== Sourcing  ==

You can get soldering kits with almost all parts already be soldered [http://shop.sirsydom.de here] for a donation. Some soldering skills are still  neccessary.

== Final assembly ==

There are some parts that must be soldered by the user:
* D100 - SMAJ supressor diode, polarity does not matter (not included in the kit, use the one from BCU kit)
* J100 - soldering pins for the KNX connector (connector not included in the kit)
* GN100 - 01x07 2.54mm SMD pin header for connecting the [[NanoBCU]] (NanoBCU not included in the kit)
* J101 - 01x08 1.27mm THT pin header for connecting the [[UP1-Progger]]
* J102 - 01x20 1.27mm angled THT pin header for connecting the application PCB. The black plastic spacer must be moved a little bit before soldering to fit


Optional parts, not included in the kit. 

* R109 - R116: 0805 SMD resistors
* U102 - SOT23-6 I2C EEPROM, e.g. Microchip AT24CS01 (or any deivce with identical footprint)
* U103 - TMP100 SOT23-5 I2C temperature sensor (or any deivce with identical footprint)

optional part placement is defined by the application.

== Developer documentation ==

=== Version history ===

* V00.01 - first prototype
* V00.02 - added footprints for SOT23 temperature sensor and EERORM, moved KNX connector 1mm to the edge, adapted tp OpenKNX

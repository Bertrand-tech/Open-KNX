== Usage ==

To connect the UP1-Controller2040 to your computer for debugging or loading firmware, there is a 7pin interface with the USB lines, power and SWD. The UP1 progger converts 5V USB level to 3.3V level of the controller and features a Micro or standard USB B jack.

For debugging, there is a 2x5 2.00mm JTAG header and a 2x5 2.54mm header.

Be carefull: never connect to USB and KNX simultaneously without using a USB isolator.

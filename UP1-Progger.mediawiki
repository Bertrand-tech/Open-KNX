== Usage ==

To connect the UP1-Controller2040 to your computer for debugging or loading firmware, there is a 8-pin interface with the USB lines, power and SWD. The UP1 progger converts 5V USB level to 3.3V level of the controller and features a Micro or standard (V00.10 only) USB B jack.

For debugging, there is a 2x5 2.00mm JTAG header and a 2x5 2.54mm header.

Be carefull: never connect to USB and KNX simultaneously without using a USB isolator.

== Sourcing  ==

You can get a SMD-assembled kit [http://shop.sirsydom.de here] for a donation.

[https://github.com/OpenKNX/OpenKNX-UP1/blob/main/hardware/EDA-Files/UP1-Progger/UP1-Progger_V00.10_gerbers.zip Gerber files V00.10] are availible in the repository.

== Assembly ==

Solder the 8x1.27 female pin header and the Progger is ready to use. For debugging solder J4/J5 at your needs.
